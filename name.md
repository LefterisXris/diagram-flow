### Product Hunt Launch
**Headline:** DiagramFlow - Interactive flow diagrams with simulation

**Tagline:** Build system diagrams, add conditional logic, simulate data flows

**Description:**
> DiagramFlow is an interactive diagram tool that goes beyond static flowcharts. Create system architectures, define conditional branches, add rich metadata, and simulate how data flows through your system with real example cases.

> Perfect for documenting APIs, ETL pipelines, microservices, and any system with complex logic. Free, open-source, and runs entirely in your browser.

### Hacker News (Show HN)
**Title:** Show HN: DiagramFlow – Interactive flow diagrams with simulation

**Post:**
> Hey HN! I built DiagramFlow, an interactive flow diagram tool for visualizing and simulating system flows.

> The motivation: I was tired of static diagrams that couldn't show conditional logic or simulate how data actually flows through a system. Tools like Mermaid are great for code-friendly diagrams, but they're static. Tools like Lucidchart are interactive but expensive and not dev-friendly.

> DiagramFlow lets you:
> - Build flow diagrams with conditional branches (if-else logic)
> - Add rich metadata to every node (tech stack, owners, links)
> - Define example cases with real data
> - Simulate and watch data flow through your system step-by-step
> - Export to JSON (VCS-friendly) or standalone HTML

> It's 100% client-side (no server), uses React Flow, and includes a Pet Clinic template to get started.

> Live demo: https://diagramflow.dev
> GitHub: https://github.com/yourusername/diagramflow

> Would love feedback from the community!
